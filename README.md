This repository contains all the data used to make the figures of the test cases 'A' and 'B' of the paper "Multi-resolution approach to condition categorical multiple-point realizations to dynamic data with iterative ensemble smoothing" (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025875).
In particular, a jupyter notebook shows how to make use of these data by calling the functions defined in mends_utils.py.

To run the jupyter notebook, make sure to have the required packages installed by running the following command: 

pip install -r requirements.txt
